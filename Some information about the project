The idea of ​​the project is to create a database for the part that deals with the buying and selling process in the Royal Palestinian Factory for Plastic Products.
We communicated with the factory to obtain some data related to this part, then we converted it into an ERD diagram to make it easier for us to build the system’s database.
Once the database was built, we created a program to enable employees and officials to use the program.
